A simple anagram game: the player is asked to create as many words as possible from a given word.

- each word is unique and is added to a table;
- each word consists of three or more letters and does not repeat the given word;
- each word is written in lowercase.

The user enters the word using the input field. There is a restart button to begin the game with a new word.
